# Ants-vs.-SomeBees
A tower defense game inspired by PopCap Games' famous title Plants vs. Zombies. 

The GUI and other visual assests were provided by https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa15/proj/ants/ (My work is seen in the ants.py file)

In Ants vs. SomeBees, players spend time interacting with a variety of different ant types and assemble their amry of ants in order to defend their ant colony from the bees' attack. Different ants have different purposes and use different tactics. Similarly different bees have different health and damage values.

The game ends if any one of the bees reaches the Queen Ant (located at the end of the tunnel if not placed) OR all the bees are killed.

To try it out yourself: (You will need python installed and have its path variables enabled)
 - Download and extract the Ants vs. SomeBees.zip
 - Open command prompt and navigate to the 'Ants vs. SomeBees' folder
 - Type the following command: python3 ants_gui.py -d easy
 - You could also replace '-d easy' with -d normal, -d hard, or -d insane to try out different difficulties.
